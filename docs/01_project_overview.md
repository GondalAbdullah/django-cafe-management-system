# Coffee Shop Management System

## Problem
Small coffee shops struggle with managing orders, discounts,
and menus efficiently without technical complexity.

## Goal
Provide a simple, intuitive web system that:
- Baristas can use without training
- Managers can control discounts & menu
- Customers can place orders easily

## Target Users
- Barista (non-technical)
- Manager (semi-technical)
- Customer (non-technical)

## Non-Goals
- Payment processing
- Inventory forecasting
- Mobile app (for now)
